# Test Voice Detection

![Web Voice Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheCodeTherapy/web-voice-detection/b751bedcde49e1bc4db9c478a155b7f8940d788b/assets/screenshot.png)

This project demonstrates real-time voice activity detection in a web browser using a pre-trained ONNX model with WebAssembly.

It captures audio from the user's microphone, processes it to identify speech segments, and provides callbacks for speech start and end events, among some other potentially useful data.

It uses the library [web-voice-detection](https://github.com/TheCodeTherapy/web-voice-detection), that I wrote to have reliable voice detection on a browser environment to use in my AI-related apps, while exposing the microphone FFT data to enable my apps to have audio visualizers.

Please feel free to ask me questions about it (or to tweet me memes) on X [@TheCodeTherapy](https://x.com/TheCodeTherapy)
